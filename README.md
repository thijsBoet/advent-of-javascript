# Day 3 - Keyboard

---
# Day 4 - Keyboard

In this project, we're going to create a computer keyboard.

You can use as many (or as few) tools, libraries, and frameworks as you'd like. If you're trying to learn something new, this would be a great way to push yourself.

**Users should be able to:**

- See the computer keyboard centered on the page
- A random letter will start to jiggle.
- The user should type the same key that's jiggling and it will stop.
- A new, random key will start jiggling

# **Taking your Project to the Next Level**

- Use a framework or library like [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/), or [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules). Or, if you're feeling particularly adventurous, try writing everything in Vanilla CSS.
- Keep track of how many keys are successfully typed correctly, the first time.
- Keep track of how many keys are missed
- Time the user to see how many successful key presses they can get within a given amount of time.

# **FAQs**

- Can I use libraries / frameworks on these projects?
  - Of course! We're providing the design files, but you can use whatever tools and frameworks you'd like.
- Oh no! I'm stuck!
  - Consider [purchasing the Solutions](http://adventofcss.com) (if you haven't already). You'll get access to a video, where James explains how to write all the code.
  - Check out the [Learn Build Teach Discord.](http://learnbuidteach.com) We have a specific channel set up, just for the Advent of JavaScript.
- Can I use this project in my portfolio?
  - Sure! But, be honest about the work that **you** did

# Getting Started

1. To get started, download the zip file. This includes all the project assets you need to get started: HTML, CSS, images, and fonts.
2. Take a look around. Look at the project's Figma file. This is a great way to see how the pieces and parts should look within the browser.
3. Open the project's `README.md` file (that's this!). It has additional information on how the project is structured.
4. Customize your project/file architecture to your liking.
5. Happy coding!
6. Once you're finished, share your work using **#adventofjs**

# Taking your Project to the Next Level

- Use a framework like [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), or [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/). Or, if you're feeling particularly adventurous, try writing everything in Vanilla JavaScript.
- Add an additional checkbox to the top of the list, with the ability to check or uncheck all items at once.
- Take a step back and try writing the HTML and CSS for this project yourself. Start with the provided Figma file. If you get stuck, you can always purchase the [Advent of CSS](http://adventofcss.com) solutions, where Amy explains how to build this.
